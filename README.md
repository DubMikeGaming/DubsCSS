# Dubs CSS
This is the krunker streamer DubMikeGaming's official krunker css
This was made by DubMike himself. I edited verb's css and made it my own. I hope you like it!
## Installation
1st you will need to download the main_custom file
the next thing you need to do is find your resource swapper in your krunker client files:
1. GatoClient
    - go to documents in files
    - find the GatoclientResourceSwapper folder and double click to open it
    - open the Mod file 
    - Create a new file called css
      - to do this right click anywhere
      - then click new folder
      - change the name to css
    - open a new file tab
   - go to downloads
   - find main_custom
   - click and hold to drag then press alt + tab to go back to the file tab with the css file
   - drop the file into the folder 
   - open gato client and it should be working!
   
This method works on every client that has a resource swapper enabled, the file names are gonna be different though. 
Official client has not been working with css by the way so it will not work on there.
